# Missionaries and Cannibals

<img src="MC.PNG" alt="example1">

The missionaries and cannibals problem is usually stated as follows. Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.(if they were, the cannibals would eat the missionaries). The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. This problem is famous in AI because it was the subject of the first paper that approached problem formulation from an analytical viewpoint (Amarel, 1968).

## Semantic Nets Agent Implementation 

This Python project implements an agent that can solve a scaled-up version of the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem in AI with an arbitrary number of missionaries and cannibals using breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithm.
